# Readme - index.php file
File index.php is a main file where Request starts. You can define environment or application flow (if you want diffrent than normal behavior). You can modify this file to change apllication flow - to do that, you can replace it's content to one of followed files (placed in the same directory):

1. **.index.php.dev** - Contains code for Developers environment.
2. **.index.php.prod** - Contains code for Production environment.
3. **.index.php.install** - Contains installation flow code.
4. **.index.php.installed** - Contains default code flow, when application is installed.

In example - when you installs CRM, **index.php** contains content from **.index.php.install** file, and after installation, this content is replaced by content from **.index.php.installed** file, that contains default production environment code.

Remember to not modify files that name starts with dot (listed up), these files aren't visible from browser, and are used by application (i.e. in App installation process) - you can copy content from these files and place content in main index.php file to change application flow.
